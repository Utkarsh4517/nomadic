## Architecture

Nomadic is built on the BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture, promoting separation of concerns and a clean, scalable codebase.

## Backend as a Service (BaaS)

The app utilizes [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/), a robust Backend as a Service platform, for seamless backend development. Appwrite provides authentication, database, file storage, and other essential backend services, allowing us to focus on creating a delightful user experience.
